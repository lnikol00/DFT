# Discrete Fourirer Transform (DFT)

The Discrete Fourier Transform, or DFT, is the Fourier transform of a discrete or finite signal. It is a special form of the Z-transform, which is located in the unit circle. The most well-known algorithm for this is the Fast Fourier Transform, or FFT.

The DFT is actually identical to the Fourier series, but now there is a 1/N on the side of the inverse transformation, and the parameters, such as X(k), are now called. Therefore, DFT can mean Discrete Fourier Transform only if the signal is strictly periodic.
